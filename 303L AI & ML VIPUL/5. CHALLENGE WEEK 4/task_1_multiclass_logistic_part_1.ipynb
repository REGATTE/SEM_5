    "- Define X and y again for sklearn Linear Regression model\n",
    "- <strong>Note:</strong>\n",
    "    - Column at position 0 with all values=1 is not required. (Handled by scikit-learn built-in class)\n",
    "    - One-hot encoding of the target column is not required. (Handled by scikit-learn built-in class)\n",
    "    - Don't scale/normalize the target column, let them be whole numbers 0,1,2,... (sklearn does not recognize continuous values as categories)\n",
    "- Train Logistic Regression Model on the training set (sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression class)\n",
    "- Run the model on testing set\n",
    "- Print 'accuracy' obtained on the testing dataset (sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score function)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further fun (will not be evaluated)\n",
    "- Compare accuracies of your model and sklearn's logistic regression model\n",
